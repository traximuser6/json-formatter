# 🧹 JSON Cleaner & Formatter — Super Recover

✨ **Transform messy JSON into clean, structured beauty!** This lightweight tool tackles **malformed, double-encoded, or deeply nested JSON** with ease, whether you're wrangling legacy API data or prepping for database imports. Available as a **Node.js CLI** for batch processing and a **web app** for interactive cleaning.

## 🎯 Why JSON Cleaner?

JSON Cleaner & Formatter is your go-to solution for taming chaotic JSON. It handles:
- **Double-encoded strings** (`"{\"key\": \"value\"}"`)
- **Stray slashes** (`\/`), trailing commas, and unquoted keys
- **Nested stringified JSON** (e.g., `data.updated.updated` or `invoice.attachment`)
- **Broken or inconsistent formatting**

Whether you're a developer, data engineer, or QA analyst, this tool saves time and headaches with **fault-tolerant parsing** and **pretty-printed output**.

## ⚙️ How It Works

### Node.js CLI
1. **Reads**: Loads raw JSON from `rawdata.txt`.
2. **Cleans**:
    - Parses stringified fields like `data.updated.updated` (arrays) and `invoice.attachment` (objects).
    - Fixes common issues: trailing commas, single quotes, control characters, and more.
3. **Outputs**: Writes pretty-printed JSON to `cleanJson.json`.

### Web App
1. **Input**: Paste messy JSON into the browser interface.
2. **Process**: Cleans and formats with real-time diagnostics.
3. **Output**: Displays readable JSON with options to copy or download.

### 🔐 Fault Tolerance
- Skips unparseable fields with warnings (e.g., `⚠️ Could not parse attachment for invoice: INV-12345`).
- Logs detailed diagnostics to console and web UI.
- Handles up to **5MB** of input with robust error recovery.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Web App
1. Visit [ttech-json-formatter.netlify.app](https://ttech-json-formatter.netlify.app/).
2. Paste your messy JSON in the input textarea.
3. Click **Clean & Format**, **Beautify**, or **Minify**.
4. Copy or download the cleaned JSON. 🎉

### Option 2: Node.js CLI
1. **Clone the repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/json-cleaner.git
   cd json-cleaner
   ```
2. **Add your JSON**: Place raw JSON in `rawdata.txt`.
3. **Run the script** (requires **Node.js v12+**):
   ```bash
   node main.js
   ```
4. **Check output**:
   ```
   ✅ Clean JSON written to cleanJson.json
   ```

## 🌟 Features
- **Dual Modes**: Interactive web app and lightweight CLI.
- **Robust Parsing**:
    - Attempts raw `JSON.parse` first.
    - Removes control characters and stray bytes.
    - Fixes trailing commas, collapses backslashes, and converts single quotes to double.
    - Quotes unquoted keys conservatively.
    - Extracts JSON-like substrings from noisy input.
    - Recursively parses nested stringified JSON.
- **User-Friendly Web UI**:
    - Real-time loader and diagnostics.
    - Interactive buttons with hover effects and toast notifications.
    - Copy/download cleaned JSON with one click.
- **Lightweight**: CLI uses only native Node.js `fs` and `path`. Web app uses minimal dependencies (jQuery, Toastr, Tailwind CSS).
- **Pretty Output**: Consistent indentation for readability.
